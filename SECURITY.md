## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please report it responsibly.

2. Email security concerns to the maintainers privately
3. Include as much detail as possible:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### What to Expect

- Acknowledgment of your report within 48 hours
- Regular updates on the progress of addressing the issue
- Credit in the security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
